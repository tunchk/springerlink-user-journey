# springerlink-user-journey

# The aim of the repo:
This test suite will serve a solution against the needs of testing regarding the user journeys of the product springer link. The test design in the first three questions will be in the text format. Lastly, the user journey automation will run on the RobotFramework which supports BDD. I choose RobotFramework because; the question is mentioning about user journey tests where it is necessarily reasonable to rely on BDD or ATDD. So, since the robotframework it is adjustable and readable for business people and is easy to use in CI/CD pipelines, I prefer to go with RobotFramework.
