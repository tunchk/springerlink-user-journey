Task1

What would be your strategy for non-functionals (cross-functionals) testing?

When it comes to selection or making a decision on what to test, how? To me it is always all about risk management.<br/>
In regards of the two testing principles:<br/>

- Exhaustive tesing is not possible <br/>
- Testing is context dependent <br/>

It is easy to mention that there can not be an easy one standard solution against the testing.<br/>
Therefore, I usually try to create a risk analysis, before deciding how to proceed with what to implement.<br/>

Hence, without having some answers, I will try to set a strategy by following some educated guesses.<br/>


1. List the types of non-functional tests you would perform for the
application above and how you would prioritise them?



2. List the tools you would use.

3. Explain where you would fit these tests in a continuous delivery
model where things go straight into production.

4. How would you present this back to the team(stakeholders) - to
get maximum buy in?
