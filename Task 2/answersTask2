What would be your strategy to test and monitor this application in production?

As I mentioned in the first question, I like to divide and manage software quality in three main aspects.
    1- Functional quality
    2- Infrastructural quality
    3- Process quality
Therefore, I would monitor the metrics in regards of this point of view. However, there is an additional important
peer for monitoring the application. The product management people, their input is more than important because; they
now needs of business and customers. So, if a squad wants to improve the quality of the product; it is a essential to 
have information about KPI's. Otherwise, it would not be possible to scale it economicaly. As a summary, to monitor 
the performance of the squads, the software, and the infrastructure; it is vital to have KPI's and create a road map
over those goals. Else, it would be an endless game which would be impossible to achieve the goal.

On the functional level, I would rely on strong self-learning processes. If the team has a test strategy against the 
known potential risks; with the help of a progressive process, functionality would be something not to worry about
anymore. In addition, it is possible to follow any BDD or ATDD framework, which can enable automations of the user jouneys.


On the Infrastructural level, I would be monitoring the metrics in regards of company's KPI's:
    -- Reusability
    -- Scalability
    -- Flexibility & Portability 
    -- Mutation Testing

On the process quality I would be monitoring the results for:
    -- Mean time between bugs
    -- Re-occuring bugs
    -- Mean time between fixes
    -- Trend in new bug creation numbers
    
Additionaly, for the testing part it might be helpful to start the Chaos Engineering practices. It would provide 
essential feedback for re-factoring the project.

1. How would you make sure that functionality developed is ready to
be monitored in production?

In my teams, I usually start with creating an SDLC where the process learns progressively. Nowadays, most of the
squads follow the agile scrum methodology, however they are not following the learning part of it. Mostly, squads are 
not implementing the learning part of the agile methodologies which actually the most important part of it. 
Therefore, by summing up the data of previous bugs, or age of bugs, or recurring bugs; I convince the team to insert
control points which are learnt from the mistakes. Right after the intial meetings, I introduce the concept of
DoR (Defintion of Ready) and DoD (Definition of Done). To create those concepts team meets togather and discuss 
the definition of the terms for their team.

To see in a flow please open the diagram ProgressiveProcess

Basically what a team should do is:
    - Pre-refine the task with the solution designer, QA and Product Manager (Like a 3 Amigos session)
        - Define the test cases
        - Define what test cases to automate in which level of testing (Integration, System, UAT)
        - Define performance metrics if necessary
        - Identify how to monitor it in the production
    - Refinement
        - Create the development tasks
        - Create the testing and automation tasks
            - Unit testing
            - Test automation needs, system and integration level
            - Performance Testing needs
            - Security testing needs
            - And whatever needs added in DoD may be inserted to the List
    - Development Phase
        - Including testing 
    - Delivery of the product (The squad is done here)
    - Research Phase (The aim is finding feedback for process enhancement so that by the feedback it would be possible to 
    enhance the software development process to prevent possible future mistakes)
        - Trying to run experiments to break the product
            - The main goal is creating or identifying new test cases
    - Production feedback collection (The aim is enhancing the product, Value Enhancement)
        - By analyzing APM tools 
        - By contacting customers
        - By usability testing results



2. List the tools you would use for monitoring/testing

Creating and following tasks would rely on Jira or any board application
For testing documentation, I personally like Test Rail but anything will work even excel.
For the automation, I personally like python. However any java junit5 solution will work with the Allure reports.
For monitoring the performance of infrastructure it is good to stick with SonarQube and any APM tools
For the process quality, I would mostly stick with the Jira. In addition, APM reports, and Test tracking tool reports
are essential too. 

If there is budget, I would create a single page dashboard per squad; and a single board for company-wise

3. Explain where you would fit these tests in a continuous delivery
model where things go straight into production.

-- Pre Analysis:
    Whenever a solution is ready, it is possible to start rightaway.
-- Unit tests:
    During every new release, in build time.
-- API Level automation:
    During every new release, in build time.
-- E2E automation:
    During every new release, after deployment.
-- UAT
    After every new feature, after the squad delivery
-- Research
    A continuos event. Regardless of release cycle.

4. How would you present this back to the team(stakeholders) - to
get maximum buy in?

I think I already explained how I would promote the approach during the explanation of my implementation way.
However, the short answer is data. By showing the relative data, people convince to an idea easily.
The most important thing is finding the related data. To be able to find the related data; I am usually visiting
peers on business, product managers, and engineering managers. After the presentation of the data, one of my current
teams has started their own Stability meeting where they discuss how to get better in the solution and fixing the 
consistent-existing problems.
